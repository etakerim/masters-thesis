	abstract = {It is not widely realised that the first paper on cepstrum analysis was published two years before the {FFT} algorithm, despite having Tukey as a common author, and its definition was such that it was not reversible even to the log spectrum. After publication of the {FFT} in 1965, the cepstrum was redefined so as to be reversible to the log spectrum, and shortly afterwards Oppenheim and Schafer defined the “complex cepstrum”, which was reversible to the time domain. They also derived the analytical form of the complex cepstrum of a transfer function in terms of its poles and zeros. The cepstrum had been used in speech analysis for determining voice pitch (by accurately measuring the harmonic spacing), but also for separating the formants (transfer function of the vocal tract) from voiced and unvoiced sources, and this led quite early to similar applications in mechanics. The first was to gear diagnostics (Randall), where the cepstrum greatly simplified the interpretation of the sideband families associated with local faults in gears, and the second was to extraction of diesel engine cylinder pressure signals from acoustic response measurements (Lyon and Ordubadi). Later Polydoros defined the differential cepstrum, which had an analytical form similar to the impulse response function, and Gao and Randall used this and the complex cepstrum in the application of cepstrum analysis to modal analysis of mechanical structures. Antoni proposed the mean differential cepstrum, which gave a smoothed result. The cepstrum can be applied to {MIMO} systems if at least one {SIMO} response can be separated, and a number of blind source separation techniques have been proposed for this. Most recently it has been shown that even though it is not possible to apply the complex cepstrum to stationary signals, it is possible to use the real cepstrum to edit their (log) amplitude spectrum, and combine this with the original phase to obtain edited time signals. This has already been used for a wide range of mechanical applications. A very powerful processing tool is an exponential “lifter” (window) applied to the cepstrum, which is shown to extract the modal part of the response (with a small extra damping of each mode corresponding to the window). This can then be used to repress or enhance the modal information in the response according to the application.},

	abstract = {Rolling Elements Bearing ({REB}) failures are the most common reason for breakdowns in rotating machine parts. The reduction of frequent catastrophes of such rotating components is essential to have maximum productivity. To have a successful prediction of health conditions, performance assessment, and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing, a valid signal processing method is a basic need. This paper proposes a novel self-adaptive signal decomposition technique: Concealed component decomposition ({CCD}). The proposed decomposition preserves transitory evidence about perilous signal points and basis waves, with a transient objective equivalent to the timescale of extrema events in the signal. The method isolates and uses the intrinsic instantaneous amplitude in balance with other essential configuration features. The proposed {CCD} technique is utilized to develop a precise bearing fault diagnosis model. A practical mode selection criterion is also proposed. The selected mode function then undergoes the implementation of envelope spectrum analysis. The proposed model has been validated over different simulated and experimental datasets of different fault types. The proposed method demonstrates its superiority to other existing signal decomposition approaches on various grounds.},

	abstract = {Spectral analysis along with the detection of harmonics and modulation sidebands are key elements in condition monitoring systems. Several spectral analysis tools are already able to detect spectral components present in a signal. The challenge is therefore to complete this spectral analysis with a method able to identify harmonic series and modulation sidebands. Compared to the state of the art, the method proposed takes the uncertainty of the frequency estimation into account. The identification is automatically done without any a priori, the search of harmonics is exhaustive and moreover the identification of all the modulation sidebands of each harmonic is done regardless of their energy level. The identified series are characterized by criteria which reflect their relevance and which allow the association of series in families, characteristic of a same physical process. This method is applied on real-world current and vibration data, more or less rich in their spectral content. The identification of sidebands is a strong indicator of failures in mechanical systems. The detection and tracking of these modulations from a very low energy level is an asset for earlier detection of the failure. The proposed method is validated by comparison with expert diagnosis in the concerned fields.},

	abstract = {Typically extrema filtration techniques are based on non-parametric properties such as magnitude of prominences andthe widths at half prominence, which cannot be used with data that possess a dynamic nature. In this work, an extrema identification that is totally independent of derivative-based approaches and independent of quan-titative attributes is introduced. For three consecutive positive terms arranged in a line, the ratio (R) of the sum of the maximum and minimum to the sum of the three terms is always 2/n, where n is the number of terms and 2/3 ≤ R ≤ 1 when n = 3. R{\textgreater}2/3 implies that one term is away from the other two terms. Applying suitable mod-ifications for the above stated hypothesis, the method was developed and the method is capable of identifying peaks and valleys in any signal. Furthermore, three tech-niques were developed for filtering non-dominating, sharp, gradual, low and high extrema. Especially, all the developed methods are non-parametric and suitable for analyzing processes that have dynamic nature such as biogas data. The methods were evaluated using automatically collected biogas data. Results showed that the extrema identification method was capable of identifying local extrema with 0\% error. Fur-thermore, the non-parametric filtering techniques were able to distinguish dominat-ing, flat, sharp, high, and low extrema in the biogas data with high robustness},

The short-time Fourier transform and the wavelet transform are the principal approaches to simultaneously decompose a signal into time and frequency components. Known limitations, such as trade-offs between time and frequency resolution, may be overcome by alternative techniques that extract instantaneous modal components. Empirical mode decomposition aims to decompose a signal into components that are well separated in the time-frequency plane allowing the reconstruction of these components. On the other hand, a recently proposed method called the “synchrosqueezing transform” ({SST}) is an extension of the wavelet transform incorporating elements of empirical mode decomposition and frequency reassignment techniques. This new tool produces a well-defined time-frequency representation allowing the identification of instantaneous frequencies in seismic signals to highlight individual components. We introduce the {SST} with applications for seismic signals and produced promising results on synthetic and field data examples.},

This property is of paramount importance when one seeks to recover the modes of a multicomponent signal ({MCS}), corresponding to the superimposition of {AM}/{FM} modes, a model often used in many practical situations. After having recalled the basic principles of {SST} and explained why, when applied to an {MCS}, it works well only when the modes making up the signal are slightly modulated, we focus on how to circumvent this limitation. We then give illustrations in practical situations either associated with gravitational wave signals or modes with fast oscillating frequencies and discuss how {SST} can be used in conjunction with a demodulation operator, extending existing results in that matter. Finally, we list a series of different perspectives showing the interest of {SST} for the signal processing community.
Résumé
Dans cet article, nous présentons le principe de la transformée synchrosqueezée ({SST}) développée pour améliorer, en utilisant des techniques de réallocation, la qualité des représentations linéaires temps–fréquence, comme les transformées de Fourier à court terme ou en ondelettes. Les transformées réallouées demeurent inversibles, ce qui est fondamental pour l'étude des signaux multicomposantes ({MCS}), i.e. la superposition de modes modulés à la fois en amplitude et en fréquence, utilisés comme modèle dans de nombreuses applications. Cependant, la {SST}, dans sa formulation initiale, n'est pas adaptée aux signaux composés de modes fortement modulés, et des améliorations, que nous présentons ici, ont récemment été proposées pour pallier ce défaut. Pour illustrer ces nouveaux développements, nous étudierons le cas des ondes gravitationnelles et des modes à phase oscillante. Dans un second temps, nous montrerons comment utiliser conjointement la {SST} et la démodulation pour améliorer la reconstruction des modes d'un {MCS}, et terminerons en évoquant différentes perspectives actuelles autour de la {SST}.},

It is not a new technique and is widely used in the industry, however with the Industry 4.0 paradigm and the need to digitize any process, it gains relevance to automatic fault detection. The Isolation Forest algorithm is implemented to detect anomalies in vibration datasets measured in an experimental apparatus composed of an induction motor and a coupling system with shaft alignment/misalignment capabilities.

	abstract = {In modern digital manufacturing, nearly 79.6\% of the downtime of a machine tool is caused by its mechanical failures. Predictive maintenance ({PdM}) is a useful way to minimize the machine downtime and the associated costs. One of the challenges with {PdM} is early fault detection under time-varying operational conditions, which means mining sensitive fault features from condition signals in long-term running. However, fault features are often weakened and disturbed by the time-varying harmonics and noise during a machining process. Existing analysis methods of these complex and diverse data are inefficient and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel method for early fault detection under time-varying conditions. In this study, a deep learning model is constructed to automatically select the impulse responses from the vibration signals in long-term running of 288 days. Then, dynamic properties are identified from the selected impulse responses to detect the early mechanical fault under time-varying conditions. Compared to traditional methods, the experimental results in this paper have proved that our method was not affected by time-varying conditions and showed considerable potential for early fault detection in manufacturing.},

In this paper, we propose a highly efficient time-series database, called {EdgeDB}, to fully utilize the capacity of the edge nodes. {EdgeDB} effectively improves the performances of both inserting and retrieving data from ingest streams by efficiently merging multiple streams and optimizing the storage data structure concurrently. {EdgeDB} first compactly organizes multiple online streams into a tablet within a time window and embeds predefined aggregate query results together. {EdgeDB} adopts Time Partitioned Elastic Index ({TPEI}) to build indexing on all tablets, enhancing the time-range query performance while reducing the memory usage by optimizing the indexing storage. {EdgeDB} further develops Time Merged Tree ({TMTree}) to combine a set of tablets into a large one, significantly boosting the write throughput and potentially strengthening the performance of inter-tablet query. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show that, compared with the state-of-the-art time-series database {BTrDB}, {EdgeDB} achieves performance improvements of up to 2.2× in insert throughput, 3.6× in write throughput, and 67\% in query latency with lower memory consumption.},

However, faced with the complexity and diversity of practical engineering, extracting the transient signal is a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel time-frequency analysis method termed the transient-extracting transform, which can effectively characterize and extract the transient components in the fault signals. This method is based on the short-time Fourier transform and does not require extended parameters or a priori information. Quantized indicators, such as Rényi entropy and kurtosis, are employed to compare the performance of the proposed method with other classical and advanced methods. The comparisons show that the proposed method can provide a much more energy-concentrated time-frequency representation, and the transient components can be extracted with a significantly larger kurtosis. The numerical and experimental signals are used to show the effectiveness of our method.},

	abstract = {While there is a wide range of approaches to monitor industrial machinery through their static components, rotating components are usually harder to monitor, since sensors are difficult to be mounted on them and continuously read during operation. However, the characteristics of rotating components may provide useful information about the machine condition to be included in monitoring algorithms, specially for long-term data analysis. In this work, wireless vibration monitoring of rotating machine parts is investigated using surface acoustic wave ({SAW}) radio frequency identification ({RFID}) tags coupled with sensors. The proposed augmented transponder solution, combined with low-latency interrogation and signal processing, enables real-time identification and wideband vibration sensing. On top of that, a multi-channel interrogation approach is used to compensate motion effects. This approach enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of low-power high-frequency components present on the vibration signatures and enables discriminant information extraction from rotating machine parts. Final feasibility is evaluated with induction motors and vibration measurements on rotating shafts are verified. In addition, a condition classification algorithm is implemented in an experimental setup based on different motor states. The results of this work open the possibility to feed predictive maintenance algorithms using new features extracted in real-time from wideband vibration measurements on rotating components.},

	abstract = {Analyzing vibration data using deep neural network algorithms is an effective way to detect damages in rotating machinery at an early stage. However, the black-box approach of these methods often does not provide a satisfactory solution because the cause of classifications is not comprehensible to humans. Therefore, this work investigates the application of explainable {AI} ({XAI}) algorithms to convolutional neural networks for vibration-based condition monitoring. For this, various {XAI} algorithms are applied to classifications based on the Fourier transform as well as the order analysis of the vibration signal. The results are visualized as a function of the revolutions per minute ({RPM}), in the shape of frequency-{RPM} maps and order-{RPM} maps. This allows to assess the saliency given to features which depend on the rotation speed and those with constant frequency. To compare the explanatory power of the {XAI} methods, investigations are first carried out with a synthetic data set with known class-specific characteristics. Then a real-world data set for vibration-based imbalance classification on an electric motor, which runs at a broad range of rotation speeds, is used. A special focus is put on the consistency for variable periodicity of the data, which translates to a varying rotation speed of a real-world machine. This work aims to show the different strengths and weaknesses of the methods for this use case: {GradCAM}, {LRP} and {LIME} with a new perturbation strategy.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIM.2002.1017721},
	abstract = {Wavelets provide a powerful tool for nonstationary signal
analysis. In vibration monitoring, the occurrence of occasional
transient disturbances makes the recorded signal nonstationary,
especially during the start-up of an engine. Through the wavelet
analysis, transients can be decomposed into a series of wavelet
components, each of which is a time-domain signal that covers a specific octave frequency band. Disturbances of small extent (duration) are amplified relative to the rest of the signal when projected to similar size wavelet bases and, thus, they can be easily detected in the
corresponding frequency band. This paper presents a new method for extracting features in the wavelet domain and uses them for
classification of washing machines vibration transient signals. The discrete wavelet transform ({DWT}), in conjunction with statistical digital signal processing techniques, is used for feature extraction. The Karhunen Loeve transform ({KLT}) is used for feature reduction and decorrelation of the feature vectors. The Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Bayesian distance classifiers, the learning vector quantization ({LVQ}) classifier, and the fuzzy gradient classifier are used for
classification of the resulting feature space. Classification results are illustrated and compared for the rising part of vibration velocity signals of a variety of real washing machines with various defects},

	title = {Early Detection of Imbalance in Load and Machine In Front Load Washing Machines by Monitoring Drum Movement},
	abstract = {Balance issues in washing machines manifest themselves in the form of vibrations.
These unwanted vibrations become more prominent at high spin speeds. They can be
detrimental to the machine’s performance and shorten lifespan by causing permanent
physical damage. Detecting these vibrations early in the wash cycle and at spin
speeds below the machine’s resonant frequency is critical in devising proper measures
to alleviate their effects. In this thesis, we focus on the two common balance issues
observed in washing machines. The first one is machine imbalance, which stems
from the improper adjustment of leveling legs. The second balance problem is the
load imbalance, which is the result of an uneven distribution of the load inside the
drum. We specifically investigate the possibility of detecting these imbalances as
early as possible using models trained on sensory data collected from the drum.
For this aim, we collect vibration data on the two types of imbalance scenarios
throughout the wash cycle. Using these data, we build supervised classification
models using different feature extraction techniques on the multivariate times series
data and different machine learning models. We compare models that are trained
with different partial data collected at different time segments early in the wash
cycle. Our results show that we can attain a 95\% F1-score with input as short as
500 ms of the wash cycle, indicating that early prediction of these two imbalances
during the wash cycle is possible. The collected data are shared for the research

	abstract = {With the fourth industrial revolution, which has become increasingly widespread in the manufacturing industry, traditional maintenance has been replaced by the industrial internet of things ({IIoT}) based on condition monitoring system ({CMS}). The {IIoT} concept provides easier and reliable maintenance. Unlike traditional maintenance, {IIoT} systems that perform real-time monitoring can provide great advantages to the company by notifying the related maintenance team members of the factory before a serious failure occurs. It is very important to detect faulty bearings before they reach the critical level during the rotation. In this study, an industry 4.0 compatible, {IIoT} based and low-cost {CMS} was created and it consists of three main parts. Firstly experimental setup, secondly {IIoT} based condition monitoring application ({CMA}) and finally machine learning ({ML}) models and their evaluation. The experimental setup contains mechanical and electronic materials. Although the most common method used in the classification of bearing damage is vibration data, it observed that characteristics such as sound level, current, rotational speed, and temperature should be included in the data set in order to increase the success of the classification. All these data were collected from the setup, which is 6203 type bearing connected to the universal motor shaft. The designed {CMA} provides real-time monitoring and recording of the data, which comes wirelessly from the setup, on a mobile device that has an Android operating system. The {CMA} can also send {SMS} and e-mail notifications to maintenance team supervisors over mobile devices in case critical thresholds are exceeded. Lastly, the data collected from the experimental setup was modeled for classification with popular {ML} algorithms such as support vector machine ({SVM}), linear discrimination analysis ({LDA}), random forest ({RF}), decision tree ({DT}), and k-nearest neighbor ({kNN}). The models were evaluated with accuracy, precision, {TPR}, {TNR}, {FPR}, {FNR}, F1 score and, Kappa metrics. During the evaluation of all models, it was observed that with the increase in the number of features in the data set, the accuracy, sensitivity, {TPR}, {TNR}, F1 score and Kappa metrics increased above 99\% at 95\% confidence interval, and {FPR} and {FNR} metrics fell below 1\%. Although {ML} models gave successful results, {LDA} and {DT} models gave results much faster than others did. On the other hand, the classification success of the {LDA} model is relatively low. However, {DT} model is the optimum choice for {CMS} due to its convenience in determining threshold values, and its ability to give fast and acceptable classification rates.},

In this paper, fuzzy logic techniques have been applied to classify frequency spectra representing various rolling element bearing faults. The frequency spectra representing a number of different fault conditions have been processed using a variety of fuzzy set shapes. The application of basic fuzzy logic techniques has allowed fuzzy numbers to be generated which represent the similarity between frequency spectra. Correct classification of different bearing fault spectra was observed when the correct combination of fuzzy set shapes and range of membership domains were used. The problem of membership overlapping found in previous studies, where classifying individual spectrum with respect to spectra that represent true fault classes was not conclusive, has been overcome. Further work is described which will extend this technique to other classes of machinery using generic software.},

	abstract = {Process industries cover a wide set of industries, in which the processes are controlled by a combination of distributed control systems ({DCSs}) and programmable logic controllers ({PLCs}). These control systems utilize various measurements such as pressure, flow, and temperature to determine the state of the process and then use field devices such as valves and other actuating devices to manipulate the process. Since there are many different types of field devices and since each device is calibrated to its specific installation, when monitoring devices, it is important to be able to transfer not only the device measurement and diagnostics but also characteristics about the device and the process in which it is installed. The current monitoring architecture, however, creates challenges for continuous monitoring and analysis of diagnostic data.

The system design seamlessly integrates existing infrastructure [e.g., highway addressable remote transducer ({HART}) and {WirelessHART} networks, and {DeltaV} {DCS}] and newly developed hardware/software components (e.g., one-way data diode and {IoT} cellular architecture) together for control network data collection and streaming of the collected device diagnostic parameters to a private cloud to perform streaming data analytics designed for fault identification and prediction. A prototype system has been developed and supported by Emerson Automation Solutions and deployed in the field for design validation and long-term performance evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever publicly reported effort on {IoT} system design for process automation applications. The design can be readily extended for condition monitoring and analysis of many other industrial facilities and processes.},

	abstract = {Rotating machinery generally consist of a driver machine such as a motor and a driven machine or load such as a compressor or pump. Several condition monitoring ({CM}) techniques have been developed over the years for the predictive maintenance of rotating machinery. An appropriate selection of these techniques needs to be established for maximizing the {ROI} (Return on investment) of such systems. This paper proposes a methodology for the proper selection of {CM} techniques based on factors such as fault detectability, fault severity, cost, ease of data collection, noise, and system criticality. Effective techniques are recommended based on applicability in the industrial scenario and research done till now. A careful scoring system was adopted and weightage was given to each factor by expert opinion depending on its importance in the industrial environment. Multi-criteria decision-making ({MCDM}) was used to obtain comparable technique combination scores. The effectiveness of a single technique was found limited in rotating machinery, effective combinations were made and scored according to important factors. Final scores were obtained and top combinations were chosen for non-critical, sub-critical, and critical systems. A possible way of implementation is also shown for remote monitoring through literature.},

The first characteristic is the absence of historical fault data. The second characteristic is that the machine is in a constant state of transient operation. An example of such a machine is the swing machinery of an electromechanical excavator. The monitoring strategy presented here employs an anomaly detection scheme together with various methods of signal processing and feature extraction. Experiments are carried out using a laboratory apparatus to show the how various configurations of the system are able to detect different types of faults.

	abstract = {In order to extract and enhance the weak fault feature of rolling element bearings in strong noise conditions, the Empirical Wavelet Transform ({EWT}) is improved and a novel fault feature extraction and enhancement method is proposed by combining the Maximum Correlated Kurtosis Deconvolution ({MCKD}) and improved {EWT} method. At first, the {MCKD} method is conducted to de-noise the signal by eliminating the non-impact components. Then, the Fourier spectrum is segmented by local maxima or minima in the envelope of the amplitude spectrum with a pre-set threshold based on the noise level. By building up the wavelet filter banks based on the spectrum segmentation result, the signal is adaptively decomposed into several sub-signals. Finally, by choosing the most meaningful sub-signal with the maximum kurtosis, the fault feature can be extracted in the squared envelope spectrum and teager energy operator spectrum of the chosen component. Both simulations and experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that the spectrum segmentation result of improved {EWT} is more reasonable than the traditional {EWT} in strong noise conditions. Furthermore, compared with commonly used methods, such as the Fast Kurtogram ({FK}) and the Optimal Wavelet Packet Transform ({OWPT}) method, the proposed method is more effective in the fault feature extraction and enhancement of rolling element bearings.},

	abstract = {Rolling bearings are one of the most important components in rotating machinery. It is important to accurately determine the center frequency and bandwidth of the resonant frequency band for bearing fault diagnosis. There are two problems with the existing methods for extracting bearing fault characteristics. First, due to the unreasonable spectrum segmentation, the determined resonant frequency band contains only partial fault information or hidden irrelevant information. Finally, because of the interference of the accidental impact, the correct fault characteristic information cannot be extracted. To solve the above problems, a time-frequency domain scanning empirical spectral negentropy method (T-{FSESNE}) based on spectral negentropy ({NE}) and empirical wavelet transform ({EWT}) is proposed in this paper. The signal is filtered twice by {EWT} filter: Firstly, the central frequencies of all resonance side bands are determined by using frequency-domain spectral negentropy, and then the optimal bandwidth of the resonance side bands is determined by using time-domain spectral negentropy. According to the determined center frequency and bandwidth, each component is extracted and analyzed by envelope spectrum to realize bearing fault diagnosis. The validity of the extracted methods is verified by bearing fault simulation and experimental signals. The results show that not only the interference of accidental impact can be effectively avoided but also the optimal center frequency and bandwidth can be determined quickly and accurately. More importantly, this method can determine the position of multiple resonance sidebands, which is more suitable for the analysis of complex fault vibration signals in rolling bearings.},

Among all kinds of diagnosis methods, empirical wavelet transform has been widely used for its characteristic of separating empirical modes from the spectrum. Although the empirical wavelet transform restrains the mode aliasing of extracting modal functions from the time domain, it runs slowly and separates a large number of invalid components. In this paper, an adaptive and fast empirical wavelet transform method is proposed. The method extracts the first feature cluster in the Fourier transform of the spectrum to reconstruct the trend spectrum. The minimum points are regarded as the initial boundaries. The key spectral negentropy is proposed to extract the frequency band which may contain main information. This method reduces the number of invalid components and computation time by filtering components before reconstruction. The simulation signal proves that the proposed method is effective and the proposed key spectral negentropy has stronger anti-noise ability than kurtosis. The experimental signals show that the method can successfully extract the fault features of inner or outer rings of bearings, and is suitable for the diagnosis of composite faults.},

Although {CFAR} algorithms have increasingly become a vital factor in the detection process, the performance of these algorithms differs according to their treatment of the received radar bins. In cases of targets in a clutter edge and multi-targets, the performance of the {GO}-, {VI}-, {OSSO}- and {OSGO}-{CFAR} algorithms are better than the performance of the {CA}-{CFAR} algorithm, while the {CA}-{CFAR} and {OS}-{CFAR} algorithms lose such targets. In this context, the {SO}-{CFAR} has a higher Pfa than the above algorithms for small targets in a clutter edge. {OSSO}-, {OSGO}, {VI}, and {CMLD} also have higher {PDS} based on their outcomes than the other algorithms in the same Pfa in non-homogenous environments.

	abstract = {Sketches, a type of probabilistic algorithms, have been widely accepted as the approximate summary of data streams. Compressing sketches is the best choice in distributed data streams to reduce communication overhead. The ideal compression algorithm should meet the following three requirements: high efficiency of compression procedure, support of direct query without decompression, and high accuracy of compressed sketches. However, no prior work can meet these requirements at the same time. Especially, the accuracy is poor after compression using existing methods. In this paper, we propose Cluster-Reduce, a framework for compressing sketches, which can meet all three requirements. Our key technique nearness clustering rearranges the adjacent counters with similar values in the sketch to significantly improve the accuracy. We use Cluster-Reduce to compress four kinds of sketches in two use-cases: distributed data streams and distributed machine learning. Extensive experimental results show that Cluster-Reduce can achieve up to 60 times smaller error than prior works. The source codes of Cluster-Reduce are available at Github anonymously [1].},

Vibration sensors physically attach to core equipments in control and manufacturing systems, e.g., motors and tubes, providing key insight into the running status of these devices. Massive readings from vibration sensors, however, pose new technical challenges to the analytical system, due to the non-continuous sampling strategy for sensor energy saving, as well as hardness of data interpretation. To maximize the utility and minimize the operational overhead of vibration sensors, we propose a new analytical framework, especially designed for vibration analysis based on its unique characteristics. In particular, our data engine targets to support Remaining Usefulness Lifetime ({RUL}) estimation, known as one of the most important problems in cyber-physical system maintenance, to optimize the replacement scheduling over the equipments under monitoring. Our empirical evaluations on real manufacturing sites show that scalable and accurate analysis over the vibration data enables to prolong the average lifetime of the tubes by 1.2x and reduce the replacement cost by 20\%.},
