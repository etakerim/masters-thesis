	abstract = {Rolling Elements Bearing ({REB}) failures are the most common reason for breakdowns in rotating machine parts. The reduction of frequent catastrophes of such rotating components is essential to have maximum productivity. To have a successful prediction of health conditions, performance assessment, and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing, a valid signal processing method is a basic need. This paper proposes a novel self-adaptive signal decomposition technique: Concealed component decomposition ({CCD}). The proposed decomposition preserves transitory evidence about perilous signal points and basis waves, with a transient objective equivalent to the timescale of extrema events in the signal. The method isolates and uses the intrinsic instantaneous amplitude in balance with other essential configuration features. The proposed {CCD} technique is utilized to develop a precise bearing fault diagnosis model. A practical mode selection criterion is also proposed. The selected mode function then undergoes the implementation of envelope spectrum analysis. The proposed model has been validated over different simulated and experimental datasets of different fault types. The proposed method demonstrates its superiority to other existing signal decomposition approaches on various grounds.},

	abstract = {Spectral analysis along with the detection of harmonics and modulation sidebands are key elements in condition monitoring systems. Several spectral analysis tools are already able to detect spectral components present in a signal. The challenge is therefore to complete this spectral analysis with a method able to identify harmonic series and modulation sidebands. Compared to the state of the art, the method proposed takes the uncertainty of the frequency estimation into account. The identification is automatically done without any a priori, the search of harmonics is exhaustive and moreover the identification of all the modulation sidebands of each harmonic is done regardless of their energy level. The identified series are characterized by criteria which reflect their relevance and which allow the association of series in families, characteristic of a same physical process. This method is applied on real-world current and vibration data, more or less rich in their spectral content. The identification of sidebands is a strong indicator of failures in mechanical systems. The detection and tracking of these modulations from a very low energy level is an asset for earlier detection of the failure. The proposed method is validated by comparison with expert diagnosis in the concerned fields.},

The ice-core time series, representing different signal characteristics, comprise electrical conductivity measurements ({ECM}), dielectric properties ({DEP}) and sulphate. Three techniques (I–{III}) utilize all the data in the time series to estimate significant thresholds for identifying peaks. Technique {IV} applies a moving window and conducts a statistical inference within the defined window. In technique V, a family of smoothed estimates of the ice-core time series is produced, and statistical tests are performed on the significant changes in the derivative of the estimates. The correction of the significance level, α, due to multiple tests is introduced and implemented in techniques {II}–V. The threshold obtained by techniques I–{III} is determined by the influence of the error term on the global variance estimate, whereas the threshold of {IV} is determined by the data within the window. The success of identifying peaks with technique V is dependent on the redundancy in the data, i.e. the sampling rate. It is concluded that techniques {II} and {III} are superior to the other techniques due to their simplicity and robustness.},

	abstract = {Typically extrema filtration techniques are based on non-parametric properties such as magnitude of prominences andthe widths at half prominence, which cannot be used with data that possess a dynamic nature. In this work, an extrema identification that is totally independent of derivative-based approaches and independent of quan-titative attributes is introduced. For three consecutive positive terms arranged in a line, the ratio (R) of the sum of the maximum and minimum to the sum of the three terms is always 2/n, where n is the number of terms and 2/3 ≤ R ≤ 1 when n = 3. R{\textgreater}2/3 implies that one term is away from the other two terms. Applying suitable mod-ifications for the above stated hypothesis, the method was developed and the method is capable of identifying peaks and valleys in any signal. Furthermore, three tech-niques were developed for filtering non-dominating, sharp, gradual, low and high extrema. Especially, all the developed methods are non-parametric and suitable for analyzing processes that have dynamic nature such as biogas data. The methods were evaluated using automatically collected biogas data. Results showed that the extrema identification method was capable of identifying local extrema with 0\% error. Fur-thermore, the non-parametric filtering techniques were able to distinguish dominat-ing, flat, sharp, high, and low extrema in the biogas data with high robustness},

The short-time Fourier transform and the wavelet transform are the principal approaches to simultaneously decompose a signal into time and frequency components. Known limitations, such as trade-offs between time and frequency resolution, may be overcome by alternative techniques that extract instantaneous modal components. Empirical mode decomposition aims to decompose a signal into components that are well separated in the time-frequency plane allowing the reconstruction of these components. On the other hand, a recently proposed method called the “synchrosqueezing transform” ({SST}) is an extension of the wavelet transform incorporating elements of empirical mode decomposition and frequency reassignment techniques. This new tool produces a well-defined time-frequency representation allowing the identification of instantaneous frequencies in seismic signals to highlight individual components. We introduce the {SST} with applications for seismic signals and produced promising results on synthetic and field data examples.},

It is not a new technique and is widely used in the industry, however with the Industry 4.0 paradigm and the need to digitize any process, it gains relevance to automatic fault detection. The Isolation Forest algorithm is implemented to detect anomalies in vibration datasets measured in an experimental apparatus composed of an induction motor and a coupling system with shaft alignment/misalignment capabilities.

However, faced with the complexity and diversity of practical engineering, extracting the transient signal is a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel time-frequency analysis method termed the transient-extracting transform, which can effectively characterize and extract the transient components in the fault signals. This method is based on the short-time Fourier transform and does not require extended parameters or a priori information. Quantized indicators, such as Rényi entropy and kurtosis, are employed to compare the performance of the proposed method with other classical and advanced methods. The comparisons show that the proposed method can provide a much more energy-concentrated time-frequency representation, and the transient components can be extracted with a significantly larger kurtosis. The numerical and experimental signals are used to show the effectiveness of our method.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIM.2002.1017721},
	abstract = {Wavelets provide a powerful tool for nonstationary signal
analysis. In vibration monitoring, the occurrence of occasional
transient disturbances makes the recorded signal nonstationary,
especially during the start-up of an engine. Through the wavelet
analysis, transients can be decomposed into a series of wavelet
components, each of which is a time-domain signal that covers a specific octave frequency band. Disturbances of small extent (duration) are amplified relative to the rest of the signal when projected to similar size wavelet bases and, thus, they can be easily detected in the
corresponding frequency band. This paper presents a new method for extracting features in the wavelet domain and uses them for
classification of washing machines vibration transient signals. The discrete wavelet transform ({DWT}), in conjunction with statistical digital signal processing techniques, is used for feature extraction. The Karhunen Loeve transform ({KLT}) is used for feature reduction and decorrelation of the feature vectors. The Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Bayesian distance classifiers, the learning vector quantization ({LVQ}) classifier, and the fuzzy gradient classifier are used for
classification of the resulting feature space. Classification results are illustrated and compared for the rising part of vibration velocity signals of a variety of real washing machines with various defects},

	title = {Early Detection of Imbalance in Load and Machine In Front Load Washing Machines by Monitoring Drum Movement},
	abstract = {Balance issues in washing machines manifest themselves in the form of vibrations.
These unwanted vibrations become more prominent at high spin speeds. They can be
detrimental to the machine’s performance and shorten lifespan by causing permanent
physical damage. Detecting these vibrations early in the wash cycle and at spin
speeds below the machine’s resonant frequency is critical in devising proper measures
to alleviate their effects. In this thesis, we focus on the two common balance issues
observed in washing machines. The first one is machine imbalance, which stems
from the improper adjustment of leveling legs. The second balance problem is the
load imbalance, which is the result of an uneven distribution of the load inside the
drum. We specifically investigate the possibility of detecting these imbalances as
early as possible using models trained on sensory data collected from the drum.
For this aim, we collect vibration data on the two types of imbalance scenarios
throughout the wash cycle. Using these data, we build supervised classification
models using different feature extraction techniques on the multivariate times series
data and different machine learning models. We compare models that are trained
with different partial data collected at different time segments early in the wash
cycle. Our results show that we can attain a 95\% F1-score with input as short as
500 ms of the wash cycle, indicating that early prediction of these two imbalances
during the wash cycle is possible. The collected data are shared for the research
community},

	abstract = {With the fourth industrial revolution, which has become increasingly widespread in the manufacturing industry, traditional maintenance has been replaced by the industrial internet of things ({IIoT}) based on condition monitoring system ({CMS}). The {IIoT} concept provides easier and reliable maintenance. Unlike traditional maintenance, {IIoT} systems that perform real-time monitoring can provide great advantages to the company by notifying the related maintenance team members of the factory before a serious failure occurs. It is very important to detect faulty bearings before they reach the critical level during the rotation. In this study, an industry 4.0 compatible, {IIoT} based and low-cost {CMS} was created and it consists of three main parts. Firstly experimental setup, secondly {IIoT} based condition monitoring application ({CMA}) and finally machine learning ({ML}) models and their evaluation. The experimental setup contains mechanical and electronic materials. Although the most common method used in the classification of bearing damage is vibration data, it observed that characteristics such as sound level, current, rotational speed, and temperature should be included in the data set in order to increase the success of the classification. All these data were collected from the setup, which is 6203 type bearing connected to the universal motor shaft. The designed {CMA} provides real-time monitoring and recording of the data, which comes wirelessly from the setup, on a mobile device that has an Android operating system. The {CMA} can also send {SMS} and e-mail notifications to maintenance team supervisors over mobile devices in case critical thresholds are exceeded. Lastly, the data collected from the experimental setup was modeled for classification with popular {ML} algorithms such as support vector machine ({SVM}), linear discrimination analysis ({LDA}), random forest ({RF}), decision tree ({DT}), and k-nearest neighbor ({kNN}). The models were evaluated with accuracy, precision, {TPR}, {TNR}, {FPR}, {FNR}, F1 score and, Kappa metrics. During the evaluation of all models, it was observed that with the increase in the number of features in the data set, the accuracy, sensitivity, {TPR}, {TNR}, F1 score and Kappa metrics increased above 99\% at 95\% confidence interval, and {FPR} and {FNR} metrics fell below 1\%. Although {ML} models gave successful results, {LDA} and {DT} models gave results much faster than others did. On the other hand, the classification success of the {LDA} model is relatively low. However, {DT} model is the optimum choice for {CMS} due to its convenience in determining threshold values, and its ability to give fast and acceptable classification rates.},

The analysis of the vibration data using methods of machine learning promises a significant reduction in the associated analysis effort and a further improvement in diagnostic accuracy. Here we publish a dataset which is used as a basis for the development and evaluation of algorithms for unbalance detection. For this purpose, unbalances of various sizes were attached to a rotating shaft using a 3D-printed holder. In a speed range from approx. 630 {RPM} to 2330 {RPM}, three sensors were used to record vibrations on the rotating shaft at a sampling rate of 4096 values per second. A development and an evaluation dataset are available for each unbalance strength. Using the dataset recorded in this way, fully connected and convolutional neural networks, Hidden Markov Models and Random Forest classifications on the basis of automatically extracted time series features were tested. With a prediction accuracy of 98.6 \% on the evaluation dataset, the best result could be achieved with a fully-connected neural network that receives the scaled {FFT}-transformed vibration data as input.},

	abstract = {Recurrent neural network ({RNN}) based autoencoders, trained in an unsupervised manner, have been widely used to generate fixed-dimensional vector representations or embeddings for varying length multivariate time series. These embeddings have been demonstrated to be useful for time series reconstruction, classification, and creation of health index ({HI}) curves of machines being used in industrial applications, based on which the remaining useful life ({RUL}) of machines can be estimated. In this study, we extend the traditional form of {RNN} autoencoders as a feature extractor for multivariate time series to a more general form in terms of arranging the order of input or output sequences and the hidden unit architecture. We apply the embeddings obtained by different variants of {RNN} autoencoders for a time series classification task and a machine {RUL} estimation problem using two publicly available datasets. A random research strategy is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of all variants for each task in order to give a fair comparison of the general performance among different variants over a large hyperparameter space, as well as the best performance that each variant can achieve compared with the best reported values in the literature. Our results show that traditional reversing the order of output time series while maintaining the order of input time series when training an {RNN} autoencoder does not show improved performance for the two studied cases. Thus, intentionally arranging the input or output order seems unnecessary for training the {RNN} autoencoder as a feature extractor of time series. We further observe that only the {RNN} architectures with gating mechanism can achieve the functionality of encoding for the time series, and none of the three common gated architectures we studied shows significantly and consistently improved performance compared to the others on the two studied cases. However, the bidirectional {RNN} autoencoders yield slightly better performance than their unidirectional counterparts.},

	doi = {10.1109/TASE.2020.3028151},
	abstract = {Traditional machine learning methods assume that training and testing data must be from the same machine running condition ({MRC}) and drawn from the same distribution. However, in several real-time industrial applications, this assumption does not hold. The traditional methods work satisfactorily in steady-state conditions but fail in time-varying conditions. In order to utilize time-varying data in variable {MRCs}, this article proposes a novel low-level knowledge transfer framework using a deep neural network ({DNN}) model for condition monitoring of machines in variable running conditions. The low-level features have been extracted in time, frequency, and time–frequency domains. These features are extracted from the source data to train the {DNN}. The trained {DNN}-based parameters are then transferred to another {DNN}, which is modified according to the low-level features extracted from the target data. The proposed approach is validated through three case studies on: 1) the air compressor acoustic data set; 2) the Case Western Reserve University bearing data set; and 3) the intelligent maintenance system bearing data set. The prediction accuracy obtained for the above case studies is as high as 100\%, 93.07\%, and 100\%, respectively, with fivefold cross-validation. These real-time results show considerable improvement in the prediction performance using the proposed approach. Note to Practitioners—Condition-based monitoring schemes are widely applicable to rotating machines in various industries since they operate in tough working situations, and consequently, unpredicted failures occur. These unpredicted failures may cause perilous accidents in the industries. {CBM} systems prevent such failures, which results in the reduction of equipment damage and, hence, increases machinery lifetime. Modern industries are so complex and generating huge data, and these data can be collected using sensors, but placing a large number of sensors is difficult and expensive for different but similar kinds of faults in industries. This also increases the cost due to additional sensors and circuits. In this article, the authors have proposed a novel low-level knowledge transfer framework using the deep neural network ({DNN})-based method for condition monitoring of machines in variable running conditions. Low-level features have been extracted to reduce the computations of {DNN} drastically with improved performance. This article also considered additional faults in the target domain, which is more practical in real-time applications. The proposed scheme has been validated with three case studies on acoustic and vibration signatures.},

At first, the {MCKD} method is conducted to de-noise the signal by eliminating the non-impact components. Then, the Fourier spectrum is segmented by local maxima or minima in the envelope of the amplitude spectrum with a pre-set threshold based on the noise level. By building up the wavelet filter banks based on the spectrum segmentation result, the signal is adaptively decomposed into several sub-signals. Finally, by choosing the most meaningful sub-signal with the maximum kurtosis, the fault feature can be extracted in the squared envelope spectrum and teager energy operator spectrum of the chosen component. Both simulations and experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is shown that the spectrum segmentation result of improved {EWT} is more reasonable than the traditional {EWT} in strong noise conditions. Furthermore, compared with commonly used methods, such as the Fast Kurtogram ({FK}) and the Optimal Wavelet Packet Transform ({OWPT}) method, the proposed method is more effective in the fault feature extraction and enhancement of rolling element bearings.},

	abstract = {Rolling bearings are one of the most important components in rotating machinery. It is important to accurately determine the center frequency and bandwidth of the resonant frequency band for bearing fault diagnosis. There are two problems with the existing methods for extracting bearing fault characteristics. First, due to the unreasonable spectrum segmentation, the determined resonant frequency band contains only partial fault information or hidden irrelevant information. Finally, because of the interference of the accidental impact, the correct fault characteristic information cannot be extracted. To solve the above problems, a time-frequency domain scanning empirical spectral negentropy method (T-{FSESNE}) based on spectral negentropy ({NE}) and empirical wavelet transform ({EWT}) is proposed in this paper. The signal is filtered twice by {EWT} filter: Firstly, the central frequencies of all resonance side bands are determined by using frequency-domain spectral negentropy, and then the optimal bandwidth of the resonance side bands is determined by using time-domain spectral negentropy. According to the determined center frequency and bandwidth, each component is extracted and analyzed by envelope spectrum to realize bearing fault diagnosis. The validity of the extracted methods is verified by bearing fault simulation and experimental signals. The results show that not only the interference of accidental impact can be effectively avoided but also the optimal center frequency and bandwidth can be determined quickly and accurately. More importantly, this method can determine the position of multiple resonance sidebands, which is more suitable for the analysis of complex fault vibration signals in rolling bearings.},

Among all kinds of diagnosis methods, empirical wavelet transform has been widely used for its characteristic of separating empirical modes from the spectrum. Although the empirical wavelet transform restrains the mode aliasing of extracting modal functions from the time domain, it runs slowly and separates a large number of invalid components. In this paper, an adaptive and fast empirical wavelet transform method is proposed. The method extracts the first feature cluster in the Fourier transform of the spectrum to reconstruct the trend spectrum. The minimum points are regarded as the initial boundaries. The key spectral negentropy is proposed to extract the frequency band which may contain main information. This method reduces the number of invalid components and computation time by filtering components before reconstruction. The simulation signal proves that the proposed method is effective and the proposed key spectral negentropy has stronger anti-noise ability than kurtosis. The experimental signals show that the method can successfully extract the fault features of inner or outer rings of bearings, and is suitable for the diagnosis of composite faults.},

	abstract = {Sketches, a type of probabilistic algorithms, have been widely accepted as the approximate summary of data streams. Compressing sketches is the best choice in distributed data streams to reduce communication overhead. The ideal compression algorithm should meet the following three requirements: high efficiency of compression procedure, support of direct query without decompression, and high accuracy of compressed sketches. However, no prior work can meet these requirements at the same time. Especially, the accuracy is poor after compression using existing methods. In this paper, we propose Cluster-Reduce, a framework for compressing sketches, which can meet all three requirements. Our key technique nearness clustering rearranges the adjacent counters with similar values in the sketch to significantly improve the accuracy. We use Cluster-Reduce to compress four kinds of sketches in two use-cases: distributed data streams and distributed machine learning. Extensive experimental results show that Cluster-Reduce can achieve up to 60 times smaller error than prior works. The source codes of Cluster-Reduce are available at Github anonymously [1].},

	abstract = {Vibration sensor is becoming an essential part of Internet of Things ({IoT}), fueled by the quickly evolving technology improving the measurement accuracy and lowering the hardware cost. Vibration sensors physically attach to core equipments in control and manufacturing systems, e.g., motors and tubes, providing key insight into the running status of these devices. Massive readings from vibration sensors, however, pose new technical challenges to the analytical system, due to the non-continuous sampling strategy for sensor energy saving, as well as hardness of data interpretation. To maximize the utility and minimize the operational overhead of vibration sensors, we propose a new analytical framework, especially designed for vibration analysis based on its unique characteristics. In particular, our data engine targets to support Remaining Usefulness Lifetime ({RUL}) estimation, known as one of the most important problems in cyber-physical system maintenance, to optimize the replacement scheduling over the equipments under monitoring. Our empirical evaluations on real manufacturing sites show that scalable and accurate analysis over the vibration data enables to prolong the average lifetime of the tubes by 1.2x and reduce the replacement cost by 20\%.},

Firstly, the acoustic emission raw signal is obtained through the whole life cycle experiment. A variety of features highly correlated to the wear state of the band saw blade are extracted through the study on the wear mechanism of the band saw blade. Secondly, a cost-sensitive support vector machine based multi-feature fusion model of acoustic emission signals is established to implement real-time determination of the wear status of band saw blades. A database for online monitoring of the wear status of band saw blades was established considering the diversity and complexity of sawing parameters, processing materials, and saw machine models in different sawing scenarios. An online intelligent monitoring system based on {LabVIEW} and {MATLAB} are established for band saw blade wear status. Validation experiment results show that the online monitoring can achieve an accuracy of 97.71\%.},

Since estimating the covariance matrix is the cornerstone of many multivariate statistical methods, the {MCD} is an important building block when developing robust multivariate techniques. It also serves as a convenient and efficient tool for outlier detection. The {MCD} estimator is reviewed, along with its main properties such as affine equivariance, breakdown value, and influence function. We discuss its computation, and list applications and extensions of the {MCD} in applied and methodological multivariate statistics. Two recent extensions of the {MCD} are described. The first one is a fast deterministic algorithm which inherits the robustness of the {MCD} while being almost affine equivariant. The second is tailored to high-dimensional data, possibly with more dimensions than cases, and incorporates regularization to prevent singular matrices.

A review of the literature reveals that this assumption is not based on quan-titative comparative evaluation of both methods. In this paper we investigate outlier detection with {LOF} and {LOCI} within the framework of one-class classification. This framework allows us to perform an empirical comparison using the {AUC} performance measure. Our experimental results show that {LOCI} does not outperform {LOF}. We discuss possible reasons for the results obtained and argue that the multi-granularity of {LOCI} in some cases may hamper rather than help the detection of outliers. It is concluded that {LOCI} does not outperform {LOF} and that the choice for either method depends on the nature of the task at hand. Future work will address the evaluation of both methods with existing one-class classifiers.},

	abstract = {To design an algorithm for detecting outliers over streaming data has become an important task in many common applications, arising in areas such as fraud detections, network analysis, environment monitoring and so forth. Due to the fact that real-time data may arrive in the form of streams rather than batches, properties such as concept drift, temporal context, transiency, and uncertainty need to be considered. In addition, data processing needs to be incremental with limited memory resource, and scalable. These facts create big challenges for existing outlier detection algorithms in terms of their accuracies when they are implemented in an incremental fashion, especially in the streaming environment. To address these problems, we first propose C\_KDE\_WR, which uses sliding window and kernel function to process the streaming data online, and reports its results demonstrating high throughput on handling real-time streaming data, implemented in a {CUDA} framework on Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU}). We also present another algorithm, C\_LOF, based on a very popular and effective outlier detection algorithm called Local Outlier Factor ({LOF}) which unfortunately works only on batched data. Using a novel incremental approach that compensates the drawback of high complexity in {LOF}, we show how to implement it in a streaming context and to obtain results in a timely manner. Like C\_KDE\_WR, C\_LOF also employs sliding-window and statistical-summary to help making decision based on the data in the current window. It also addresses all those challenges of streaming data as addressed in C\_KDE\_WR. In addition, we report the comparative evaluation on the accuracy of C\_KDE\_WR with the state-of-the-art {SOD}\_GPU using Precision, Recall and F-score metrics. Furthermore, a t-test is also performed to demonstrate the significance of the improvement. We further report the testing results of C\_LOF on different parameter settings and drew {ROC} and {PR} curve with their area under the curve ({AUC}) and Average Precision ({AP}) values calculated respectively. Experimental results show that C\_LOF can overcome the masquerading problem, which often exists in outlier detection on streaming data. We provide complexity analysis and report experiment results on the accuracy of both C\_KDE\_WR and C\_LOF algorithms in order to evaluate their effectiveness as well as their efficiencies.},

This is the problem of partitioning a set of observations into clusters such that the intra-cluster observations are similar and the inter-cluster observations are dissimilar. The traditional set-up where a static dataset is available in its entirety for random access is not applicable as we do not have the entire dataset at the launch of the learning, the data continue to arrive at a rapid rate, we can not access the data randomly, and we can make only one or at most a small number of passes on the data in order to generate the clustering results. These types of data are referred to as data streams. The data stream clustering problem requires a process capable of partitioning observations continuously while taking into account restrictions of memory and time. In the literature of data stream clustering methods, a large number of algorithms use a two-phase scheme which consists of an online component that processes data stream points and produces summary statistics, and an offline component that uses the summary data to generate the clusters. An alternative class is capable of generating the final clusters without the need of an offline phase. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the data stream clustering methods and an overview of the most well-known streaming platforms which implement clustering.},

Beside the limited memory and one-pass constraints, the nature of evolving data streams implies the following requirements for stream clustering: no assumption on the number of clusters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and ability to handle outliers. While a lot of clustering algorithms for data streams have been proposed, they oﬀer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present {DenStream}, a new approach for discovering clusters in an evolving data stream. The “dense” micro-cluster (named core-micro-cluster) is introduced to summarize the clusters with arbitrary shape, while the potential core-micro-cluster and outlier micro-cluster structures are proposed to maintain and distinguish the potential clusters and outliers. A novel pruning strategy is designed based on these concepts, which guarantees the precision of the weights of the micro-clusters with limited memory. Our performance study over a number of real and synthetic data sets demonstrates the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of our method.},

As maintenance expenses of industrial machines are around 60\% to 70\% of the production costs [1], an efficient and real-time method of fault detection is essential for reducing the cost of machine maintenance and prolonging the equipment's life, thereby decreasing the production expenses. In this article, a novel high-performance and precise anomaly detection framework based on edge computing technology is developed to enable real-time health monitoring of industrial assets. As such, hardware and firmware design is pursued to enable execution of all critical tasks such as data acquisition and preprocessing, feature extraction, and training the algorithm on the edge node, i-e. the microcontroller. This is a big challenge given the processing power and memory limitation of the microcontroller. The sensor used here is a 3-axis accelerometer for acquiring vibration signals. After storing enough training data in Flash memory of the {MCU}, an autoencoder with three hidden layers is trained on the edge to model the machine's healthy state. Finally, the reconstruction error of unseen data is used to detect anomalies. As far as we know, this is the first article that trains an artificial neural network ({ANN}) on an {MCU} and does the whole process of condition monitoring on edge. The design is validated by testing the framework on a centrifugal pump. The test result shows that the system can detect various pump faults with over 99.9\% precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 Score.},

	abstract = {In condition based maintenance, different signal processing techniques are used to sense the faults through the vibration and acoustic emission signals, received from the machinery. These signal processing approaches mostly utilise time, frequency, and time-frequency domain analysis. The features obtained are later integrated with the different machine learning techniques to classify the faults into different categories. In this work, different statistical features of vibration signals in time and frequency domains are studied for the detection and localisation of faults in the roller bearings. These are later classified into healthy, outer race fault, inner race fault, and ball fault classes. The statistical features including skewness, kurtosis, average and root mean square values of time domain vibration signals are considered. These features are extracted from the second derivative of the time domain vibration signals and power spectral density of vibration signals. The vibration signal is also converted to the frequency domain and the same features are extracted. All three feature sets are concatenated, creating the time, frequency and spectral power domain feature vectors. These feature vectors are finally fed into the K- nearest neighbour, support vector machine and kernel linear discriminant analysis for the detection and classification of bearing faults. With the proposed method, the reduction percentage of more than 95\% percent is achieved, which not only reduces the computational burden but also the classification time. Simulation results show that the signals are classified to achieve an average accuracy of 99.13\% using {KLDA} and 96.64\% using {KNN} classifiers. The results are also compared with the empirical mode decomposition ({EMD}) features and Fourier transform features without extracting any statistical information, which are two of the most widely used approaches in the literature. To gain a certain level of confidence in the classification results, a detailed statistical analysis is also provided.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of rotating machinery is an essential activity for asset management today. Due to the large amount of monitored equipment, analyzing all the collected signals/features becomes an arduous task, leading the specialist to rely often on general alarms, which in turn can compromise the accuracy of the diagnosis. In order to make monitoring more intelligent, several machine learning techniques have been proposed to reduce the dimension of the input data and also to analyze it. This paper, therefore, aims to compare the use of vibration features extracted based on machine learning models, expert domain, and other signal processing approaches for identifying bearing faults (anomalies) using machine learning ({ML})—in addition to verifying the possibility of reducing the number of monitored features, and consequently the behavior of the model when working with reduced dimensionality of the input data. As vibration analysis is one of the predictive techniques that present better results in the monitoring of rotating machinery, vibration signals from an experimental bearing dataset were used. The proposed features were used as input to an unsupervised anomaly detection model (Isolation Forest) to identify bearing fault. Through the study, it is possible to verify how the {ML} model behaves in view of the different possibilities of input features used, and their influences on the final result in addition to the possibility of reducing the number of features that are usually monitored by reducing the dimension. In addition to increasing the accuracy of the model when extracting correct features for the application under study, the reduction in dimensionality allows the specialist to monitor in a compact way the various features collected on the equipment.},

Especially for weak fault features extraction, existing single narrow band demodulation methods have worse performance under low signal to noise ratio condition. According to the mechanism of rotating machinery, both narrow and broad frequency band modulated signals exist simultaneously. Therefore, weak fault features can be obtained through demodulation of multiple narrow frequency bands rather than only one resonance narrow band. In this study, a novel weak feature extraction method is proposed based on used as a good filtermultiple frequency bands demodulation. The superiority of the proposed method is corroborated by simulation analysis and applications of a centrifugal pump and a propeller. By simulation analysis, the proposed multiple frequency bands demodulation ({MFBD}) method has better demodulation performance than Fast Kurtogram, Autogram and Fast-{SC} for weak modulation features. The applications results suggested that the proposed {MFBD} provided a clearer characteristic frequency identification than Fast Kurtogram, Autogram and Fast-{SC}, especially in weak modulation condition. Therefore, the proposed {MFBD} method provides a reliable basis for weak fault signal extraction, which shows good engineering significance for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery and passive detection of propeller.},

	abstract = {Empirical wavelet transform ({EWT}) has become an effective tool for signal processing. However, its sensitivity to noise may bring side effects on the analysis of some noisy and non-stationary signals, especially for the signal which contains the close frequency components. In this paper, an improved empirical wavelet transform is proposed. This method combines the advantages of piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial ({PCHIP}) and the {EWT}, and is named {PCHIP}-{EWT}. The main idea of the proposed method is to select useful sub-bands from the spectrum envelope. The proposed method selects the maximum points of the spectrum to reconstruct the spectrum envelope on the basis of {PCHIP}. Then, a new concept and a threshold named the Local Power ({LP}) and λ are defined. Based on the new concept {LP} and the λ, the useful sub-bands can be obtained. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the {PCHIP}-{EWT} is effective in analyzing noise and non-stationary signals, especially those that contain the closely-spaced frequencies.},

This makes the method highly efﬁcient because it requires no model restructuring when adapting to evolving data streams. Our analysis shows that Streaming {HS}-Trees has constant amortised time complexity and constant memory requirement. When compared with a state-of-theart method, our method performs favourably in terms of detection accuracy and runtime performance.

	title = {Spectral negentropy and kurtogram performance comparison for bearing fault diagnosis},
	abstract = {While investigating rotating faults in vibration signals, one of the typical symptoms is the presence of repetitive transients, which are characterized by impulsive and cyclostationarity signature. The approach quite popular nowadays in the industry for their detection is time-frequency techniques. Those techniques are mainly analysis tools as opposed to processing tools, and in any case, are unable to offer a versatile methodology that applies to all mechanical signals in all circumstances. The paper is motivated by ideas borrowed from thermodynamics, where transients are seen as departures from a state of equilibrium; it is proposed to measure the negentropy of the squared envelope ({SE}) and the squared envelope spectrum ({SES}) of the signal. The main objective of the work is to investigate connections in both negentropy and kurtogram approaches to capture the signature of this repetitive behavior. The methodology used in this paper proposes to display spectral negentropy as images. The impulsive events are then detected and localized in frequency by high values of the squared envelope spectrum ({SES}) infogram in some frequency bands. In order to analyze the signal in the frequency domain, the Short-Time Fourier Transform ({STFT}) can then be used. The {STFT} is suggested in this study due to its simplicity and high ﬂexibility. On the other hand, {STFT} is used for the analysis of kurtosis of temporal signals; this is well known as Kurtogram. For fault, such as bearings, Kurtogram was demonstrated to be efﬁcient.},

Early bearing fault diagnosis has great signiﬁcance to the operation security of motors. The main contribution of this paper is to illustrate Gaussian white noise in bearing vibration signals seriously masks the weak fault characteristics in the diagnosis based on the Teager–Kaiser energy operator envelope, and to propose improved {TKEO} taking both accuracy and calculation speed into account. Improved {TKEO} can attenuate noise in consideration of computational efﬁciency while preserving information about the possible fault. The proposed method can be characterized as follows: a series of band-pass ﬁlters were set up to extract several component signals from the original vibration signals; then a denoised target signal including fault information was reconstructed by weighted summation of these component signals; ﬁnally, the Fourier spectrum of {TKEO} energy of the resulting target signal was used for bearing fault diagnosis. The improved {TKEO} was applied to a vibration signal dataset of run-to-failure rolling bearings and compared with two advanced diagnosis methods. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in early bearing fault detection.},

In the current work, {ML} models, namely, Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) and K-Nearest Neighbor ({KNN}), are used to classify the faults associated with different ball bearing elements. Using open-source Case Western Reserve University ({CWRU}) bearing data, machine learning classifiers are trained with extracted time-domain and frequency-domain features.

signatures has generally relied upon Fourier-based analysis as a means of translating vibration signals in the time domain into the frequency domain. However, Fourier analysis provided a poor representation of signals well localized in time. In this case, it is difficult to detect and identify the signal pattern from the expansion coefficients because the information is diluted across the whole basis. The wavelet packet transform ({WPT}) is introduced as an alternative means of extracting time-frequency information from vibration signatures. The resulting {WPT} coefficients provide one with arbitrary time-frequency resolution of a signal. With the aid of statistical-based feature selection criteria, many of the feature components containing little discriminant
information could be discarded, resulting in a feature subset having a reduced number of parameters without compromising the classification performance. The extracted reduced dimensional feature vector is then used as input to a neural network classifier. This significantly reduces the long training time that is often associated with the neural network classifier and improves its generalization capability},
