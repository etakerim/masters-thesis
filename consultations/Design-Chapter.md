  - **UML diagram**:
      - Block diagram for HW connections:
          - Accel (SPI, INT1,2) -> ESP -> (SDIO)Â SD card
              - ESP-IDF
              - Detached Switch (INT [34] replace button) and LED (GPIO [5]) to indicate recording
              - **Storage API (SDMMC)** SD card: (GPIO15 [HS2_CMD], GPIO14 [HS2_CLK], GPIO2 [HS2_DATA0])
                  - https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.1.2/esp32/api-reference/storage/fatfs.html#using-fatfs-with-vfs-and-sd-cards
              - **Peripherals API (SPI Master Driver)** Accel: (3.3V, GND, MISO [16], MOSI [32], CLK [33], CS [13], INT1 [35], INT2 [36]) Sensor max. 10 MHz

                  - Driver: https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/IIS3DWB-PID/
              - <!-- Most of ESP32's peripheral signals have a direct connection to their dedicated IO\_MUX pins. However, the signals can also be routed to any other available pins using the less direct GPIO matrix. If at least one signal is routed through the GPIO matrix, then all signals will be routed through it. SPI2: MISO (12), MOSI (13), CLK (14); SPI3: MISO (19), MOSI (23), CLK (18), CS (5) --> 

      - Activity: Firmware fuction:
          - start measurement (switch) -> config sd card -> config accel (FIFO continous mode, INT to read ODR) / -> int -> read FIFO accel -> write buffer to SD card
      - Activity: Pipeline for feature extraction and selection (online)
          1. Take chunk of samples
          2. Compute temporal domain features from whole chunk
          3. Compute spectral domain features from whole chunk with window size and Welch
          4. Compute magnitudes of feature vectors to achieve axis independence. -> Send from edge device with timestamp
          5. <- Send label to timestamp to edge device (after some time)
          6. Running Compute rank of product of running corr, f statistic, mutual infomation (normalization not neccessary, forgetting factor?)
          7. When rank is stable n iterations start sending only subset + features with immidiate close ranks (first 3 + ranks up to 40% of full rank)
	- Component: whole infrastructure

 ### **Design semi-supervised feature selection**
- Feature selection -> KNN -> Infer labels -> Feature selection
