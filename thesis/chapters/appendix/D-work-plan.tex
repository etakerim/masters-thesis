The semester for DP2 was split into 3 periods. Feature engineering and ML model evaluation was planned from \nth{1} to \nth{4} week, and technical inspections and plan of measurement in weeks \nth{4} to \nth{8}.

In reality, these tasks switched order because, between \nth{1} to \nth{5} week, we needed to acquire alternative partner and check their machiners for viability in our study. Only then since \nth{4} until \nth{11} week, the main focus was on experiments with the MaFaulDa. 

Lastly, preliminary measurements were conducted, as was the plan. The requirements were presented for the new sensor device and its firmware.

The final semester aimed at gathering dataset from compressors and water pumps with the accelerometer data logger. The k-NN model was validated with different hyperparameters. The data collection finished sooner in \nth{7} week whereas originally it was planned until \nth{10} week because it became apparent that during a such short period, the change in machine vibrations would be negligible. The preparation for IIT.SRC conference was also not originally planned and took time away from finishing the thesis.
