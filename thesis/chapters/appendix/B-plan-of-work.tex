The semester for DP2 was split into 3 periods. Feature engineering and ML model evaluation was planned from \nth{1} to \nth{4} week, and technical inspections and plan of measurement in weeks \nth{4} to \nth{8}.

In reality, these tasks switched order because between \nth{1} to \nth{5} week, we needed to acquire alternative partner and check their machiners for viability in our study. Only then from \nth{4} to \nth{11} week the main focus was on experiments with the MaFaulDa. 

Lastly, preliminary measurements were conducted, as was the plan. Requirements were presented for the new sensor device and its firmware.
