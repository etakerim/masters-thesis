\section{Signal preprocessing}
The vibration signals in a factory environment are inherently full of disturbances from adjacent equipment or irregular movement during object manipulation in the surrondings. In addition, accelerometers suffer from systematic measurement errors in the form of zero-g offset and bias that originates from a constant force of gravity. These unavoidable distortions are suppressible to some extent with digital filters. In the preprocessing stage we consider detrending, noise reduction with adaptive filters, and time synchronous averaging to supress interference among components.

\subsection{Detrending}
The oscillatory motion should be centered around the zero level for further manipulation. The constant offset is eliminated simply by subtracting the overall average from the signal. Moreover high pass DC blocker infinite impulse response (IIR) filter of 1st order can adjust to shifts of the mean value (Equation~\ref{equ:iir-dc-blocker}). The transition band depends upon the choice of corner frequency $f_{3dB}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:dc-blocker}).

\begin{equation} \label{equ:iir-dc-blocker}
y_k = (1 - \frac{\omega}{2}) \cdot (x_k  -  x_{k - 1}) + (1 - \omega) \cdot y_{k - 1}; \quad \omega = 2\pi \cdot \frac{f_{3dB}}{f_s}
\end{equation}

A steeper 3~dB attenuation band can be achieved by increasing the order of the filter. Then the cutoff frequency should be such that filter coefficients are fractional numbers to counteract rounding errors~\cite{tittelbach-helmrich_digital_2021}.

	\caption{Transfer function of 1st order DC blocker filters ~\cite{tittelbach-helmrich_digital_2021}}
	\label{fig:dc-blocker}
\end{figure}

The finite impulse response (FIR) filter is not recommended for DC component removal because of the undesirable ripple effect with the small number of taps. Cascaded-integrator-comb (CIC) filters are proposed as an alternative instead~\cite{lyons_understanding_2011}.

\subsection{Adaptive noise cancellation}
Adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) involves an adaptive filter that self-adjusts coefficients through an update algorithm in response to the reference noise signal.  The objective of this filter is to minimize the cost function of mean square error (MSE) in error signal $e_k$ between signal contaminated with additive Gaussian noise $d_k$ and filter output $y_k$. Additive noise $n_k$ is assumed to be correlated with noise signal $\mathbf{X_k}$~\cite{diniz_adaptive_2020}.

Wiener-Hopf equations solve the optimal gradient of MSE function and FIR filter coefficient vector $\mathbf{W_k}$.  The least mean squares (LMS) algorithm recursively approximates this analytical solution with the method of steepest descent (Equation~\ref{equ:lms-adaptive-filter})~\cite{diniz_adaptive_2020}. The multiple parameters are to be considered in the evaluation of filter performance: convergence rate, estimated error, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

\begin{ceqn}\begin{align} \label{equ:lms-adaptive-filter}
\mathbf{W}_{k+1} = \mathbf{W}_{k} + 2 \mu \mathbf{X}_{k}  e_k
\end{align}\end{ceqn}

The convergence stability is affected by step size $\mu$ which is bounded from above with the inverse of the maximal eigenvalue of input covariance matrix $\lambda_{max}$. The normalized least mean squares (NLMS) can handle input of varying scales  (Equation~\ref{equ:nlms-adaptive-filter}).

\begin{ceqn}\begin{align} \label{equ:nlms-adaptive-filter}
\mathbf{W}_{k+1} = \mathbf{W}_{k} + \frac{\mu}{\lVert\mathbf{X}_{k}\rVert^2} \mathbf{X}_{k}  e_k
\end{align}\end{ceqn}

\subsection{Time synchronous averaging}
Time synchronous averaging is dimished the impact of sources unrelated to the harmonics of the rotational frequency in the vibrations. Time-domain waveform is averaged over $N$ points and aligned to synchronization pulse with period $T$ (Equation~ref{equ:tsa-average}). This technique has been successfully applied to the gearbox and bearing fault diagnosis~\cite{davies_handbook_2012,nandi_condition_2019}
\begin{ceqn}\begin{align}
x_{TSA} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1}{x(t + nT)}
\label{equ:tsa-average}
\end{align}\end{ceqn}

\section{Feature engineering}
Before the raw observations of the machine condition are input into a machine learning model, the descriptive and summarizing numerical attributes are calculated. The informative features are selected from the provided set to determine a diagnosis.

Among the main advantages of add-in extraction effort, as opposed to processing samples unmodified, is to gain better classification precision and reduce computational burden downstream through dimensionality reduction techniques. Predictive maintenance has ideal prerequisites for the application of feature engineering because the signal characteristics are pseudo-stationary, and the trend monitoring variables are established out of extensive domain expertise in mechanics.

The steps to undertake in the transformation of source data streams to a knowledge of machine status begins with
preprocessing that continues to feature extraction, then feature selection and the ultimate result is dependent on the model.
